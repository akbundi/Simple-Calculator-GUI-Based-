<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<a href="https://github.com/duckmaniac/simple-calculator">
  <img src="assets/demo.gif" alt="Demonstration" width="300px">
</a>

Here's my first attempt at a C++ GUI project: a straightforward calculator using the SFML library. This project was a big step for me. I learned a lot, and some of its code even became the basis for my own small game engine. I hope it inspires others to start their projects too ðŸš€

Features:
* Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
* Keyboard and mouse input support
* Clear and responsive UI

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start your calculating journey, ensure:

* You have a CMake to build a project.
* The Boost 1.83.0 and SFML 2.6.0 library is set up and ready.
* In order to run this code, you will need a Windows operating system.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/duckmaniac/simple-calculator.git
   ```
2. Navigate to project's root directory
   ```sh
   cd "path to dowloaded repo"
   ```
3. Set up path to libraries in CMakeLists.txt
   ```cmake
   set(CPP_LIBRARIES_DIR "path to libraries")
   set(SFML_DIR "${CPP_LIBRARIES_DIR}/SFML-2.6.0/lib/cmake/SFML")
   set(BOOST_ROOT "${CPP_LIBRARIES_DIR}/Boost/boost_1_83_0")
   ```
4. Run the configuration command
   ```sh
   cmake .
   ```
5. Build the project
   ```sh
   cmake --build .
   ```
